### Question 1
*Load the data set using a local file name (using here). Notice that the file is included in the forked repository.*

```{r}
here::i_am("r-101-grade-analysis.Rproj")
library(ggplot2)
library(dplyr)
library(tidyr) 

grades <- read.csv("grades.csv")
```


### Question 2
*Compute the minimum, maximum, median and mean grade at the Exam and include the results as a table in the rendered document (using, e.g. knitr::kable).*

```{r}
q2 <- grades |> 
  summarize(
    Min = min(Exam, na.rm=TRUE), 
    Max = max(Exam, na.rm=TRUE), 
    Median = median(Exam, na.rm=TRUE),
    Mean = mean(Exam, na.rm=TRUE)
  ) 
knitr::kable((q2), "simple")
```


### Question 3 
*Counts the number of students who did not take the final exam (i.e. for whom Exam is NA) and include the results in a sentence in your rendered document.* 

```{r}

```
